          <p>I was the nightside news editor when this flash flooding started. I worked very closely to communicate with the breaking news reporter, who was in the newsroom with me; staff photographers, who were collecting footage of flooding ; and news editors, who helped look for updates from authorities on local media. I produced this story with the goal of keeping readers informed on critical safety information. I collaborated with staff to update for road closures, attach videos, and embed flood warnings and images from Twitter.</p>

          <p>While editing this, I took extra care to make sure the story was put in proper context. I made sure to link to KC Star stories about some of the hate incidents mentioned, and I included videos that ran with those stories as well to create a complete package. I wrote the headline and edited the metadata for this story, which were key elements that helped it perform exceptionally well on search engines — at one point if you searched "NAACP," this was the first news story to pop up.</p>

          <p>While editing this story, I took extra care to use inclusive language when talking about disabilities. At one point a quote read that some of the clients were "confined to wheelchairs." I spoke with the news editor of this piece and we decided to leave that part of the quote out because wheelchairs give people with disabilities freedom to move rather than limit them.</p>

          <p>While checking this June 13, 2016, article, it came to my attention that swimmer Mack Darragh couldn't have qualified for the 200-meter fly with his time in the trials. I brought it to the reporter's attention and the error was fixed the next day. I also reorganized the story to improve its flow.</p>

          <p>I revisited this 2014 Norm Stewart profile as a project to go with an April 30, 2016, story about a new ESPN documentary on the legendary Missouri basketball coach. I went through and made changes to the story, wrote subheads, embedded photos, and chose lines to display as pull quotes to complete the story's longform web presentation.</p>

          <p>I edited and laid out this Feb. 23, 2016 story as a web centerpiece for that morning. The process involved writing captions and embedding photos in the story on top of copy editing. While looking over the story I noticed a discrepancy between the total cost of the project and the total cost of renovating the homes. I alerted the reporter and had him consult his source to come up with an explanation, which was added after detailing the cost per unit.</p>
